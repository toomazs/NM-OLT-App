----- ATTENTION!! - This file is completely useless in the project -
- This is an example of how you should structure your secret file.
- In short, wherever it says SSH_USER & SSH_PASS, you should insert the credentials to access your private OLT.
- Below, in OLT_LIST, add the names of your OLTs, followed by the IPs to access them.
- The project handles this automatically, as long as that .java is set and located in /src along with the Main.


public class Example {
    public static final String SSH_USER = "usuario";
    public static final String SSH_PASS = "senha";

    public static final String[][] OLT_LIST = {
            {"OLT_01", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_02", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_03", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_04", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_05", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_06", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_07", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_09", "192.168.0.1"},
            {"OLT_10", "192.168.0.1"},
    };
}
